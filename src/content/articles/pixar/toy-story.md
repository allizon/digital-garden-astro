## Thoughts

We just watched the original _Toy Story_, the first of the thirty-ish movies
which will make up my [Pixar Newsletter](/pixar) project. Trying to watch it
with objective eyes knowing what Pixar will prove themselves capable of later
was...kinda hard, in a way. The voices were uniformly excellent[^1], of course,
and the script zips right along -- the whole movie clocks in at less than an
hour-and-a-half. It's still hilarious and entertaining as hell.

<p class="callout left"> this would be in a callout, yes, with the meta info
about the cast and stuff? and it doesn't get too big, does it?</p>

But it's impossible to watch now with the same amazement I felt in 1995.
I mean, _of course_, right? The fact is that no one had done anything like that
before, made an _entire feature_ using computer animation, and it truly felt
revolutionary. Now every mainstream American animated movie that comes out is
done via computer, and even the very rare "hand-drawn" feature still features
a ton of computer assistance. (Plenty of _actual_ hand-drawn films are still
produced, of course, and not _only_ from Studio Ghibli. But that might be
a post for another time.)

[^1]:
    As distasteful as I actually find Tim Allen, I absolutely have to admit
    that he energizes Buss with just the right mixture of bravado,
    credulousness and vulnerability. Between the four _Toy Story_ movies and
    _Galaxy Quest_, I find myself enjoying far more Tim Allen than I feel
    should be warranted.

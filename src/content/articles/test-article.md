This is a test post for the content collections. I need to write a bunch
of quick copy in here just to test some stuff. Probably I could pull from
something in Obsidian...?

- How do I want to transfer the flow of text from Obsidian -> Site, given
  that I'm not putting my _whole_ garden up there? Given that Astro can
  read Markdown, it should be pretty easy...
- Astro note (maybe need a page on this): Note the difference between what
  happens on the _server_ and what happens on the _client_. Trying to
  `console.log` a content collection happens on the server, so you'll see
  that in the logs in the terminal.
- What do I do with `allizon.dev`?
- Where in the hell did I have `allizon.io` configured to point at that
  Netlify instance!?
  - It _works_ now (once I configured the deployments correctly), but I'm
    still a little unclear on how I got the hostname to point at Netlify,
    since it doesn't look like they are in either A2Hosting or Namecheap?
  - I'm guessing that I set it up with Netlify DNS, though damned if I can
    find out what to do with it now. Not that I need to, I guess, as long
    as it's working correctly?
